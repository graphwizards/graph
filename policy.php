This Privacy Policy applies to graphwizards.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "graphwizards.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

               - Website Visitors<br><br></b>
               Like most website operators, Graphwizards collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Graphwizards's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Graphwizards's visitors use its website. From time to time, Graphwizards may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
               Graphwizards also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://graphwizards.com blog posts. Graphwizards only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
               <br><br><br> <b>
